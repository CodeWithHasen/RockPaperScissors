# RockPaperScissors
This project creates a Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It captures user choices via event listeners and generates random computer choices with Math.random(). Conditional logic determines the winner or a draw, updates scores, and displays messages, making the game interactive and engaging.
